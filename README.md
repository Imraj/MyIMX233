## Lets me see if I can build a linux Computer

I am starting with freescale microprocessor MCIMX233 128 LQFP and 64MB DDR2 SDRAM.
There is no special goal for this project. I am just curious. 

There are a few drivers of this project.
Until recently I didn't know of a decent opensource software for PCB designing or circuit designing which can be used to design complicated circuits involving microprocessor.
I recently discovered KiCAD which is opensource pcb designing software and people have done microprocessor design with it eg. OLinuXino. I am trying to learn PCB designing using KiCADnow.
Second driver was Clementine Core project which I saw in circuitmaker website. This schematic looked so simple and pcb was on 2 layer design, which changed my thought process altogether that linux running board designs may be something I can try.
Third driver was LibreCalc which almost proved that KiCAD can be used to design IMX233 based board. I hope to learn from their mistakes, but a newbee like me can uncover a whole lot of new mystries.

So I have put together a mashup of schematic design of IMX233 and 64MB RAM. 

This project is a work in progress and there is no gurantee that I will ever be able to complete it :).
